// Frases famosas organizadas por longitud
export const QUOTES_BY_LENGTH = {
  short: [ // 12–22 palabras
    "Discipline is doing what needs to be done, even when you don't feel like doing it at all.",
    "Success is not about luck - it's built from daily habits, small wins, and constant self-reflection.",
    "You won't always feel motivated, but discipline will keep you going when your emotions fade.",
    "The only competition that truly matters is the person you were yesterday - keep improving daily.",
    "Progress is made in silence - through effort, consistency, and the will to show up every day."
  ],
  medium: [ // 23–44 palabras
    "The real transformation happens in the quiet, boring moments where you choose to act with discipline, even when no one is watching and you have every excuse not to. That's when greatness is formed.",
    "You don’t rise to the level of your goals — you fall to the level of your systems. Build habits that pull you forward, especially on the days when motivation isn’t there to push you.",
    "Dreams are only as powerful as the effort you're willing to invest in them daily. Every habit, every choice, every moment you stay committed, becomes a brick in the foundation of your future success.",
    "Momentum isn’t built from massive effort once in a while — it’s born from consistent focus, small deliberate actions, and the belief that every day counts toward something greater than where you started.",
    "You can’t fake effort. The results will always reflect the work you’ve actually done — not the work you intended, promised, or wished for. Show up, even when it’s tough. Especially then."
  ],
  long: [ // 45–70 palabras
    "Every time you choose discipline over distraction, progress over comfort, and focus over fear, you’re not just getting closer to your goal — you’re actively becoming someone who doesn’t quit, someone who doesn’t negotiate with excuses. You’re developing the mindset that refuses to settle, and that’s the real power. Not just what you do — but who you become through doing it.",
    "You won’t remember every little detail of the hard days, but you will carry the strength they built in you. It’s not about perfection, but about showing up. About becoming the kind of person who follows through when things aren’t exciting anymore. That’s the version of you that’s going to achieve everything you ever dreamed of.",
    "The key to real growth isn’t intensity, it’s consistency. Motivation might get you started, but only structure and discipline will carry you through the times you don’t feel like showing up. The people who go the farthest aren’t always the most talented — they’re the ones who kept going, one small intentional decision at a time, for years.",
    "It’s easy to chase success when everything feels aligned — when you’re inspired, motivated, and well-rested. But the test of your future self is found in the hard days. When no one is watching. When quitting would be easier. That’s where identity is forged. That’s when your future self starts thanking you for not giving in.",
    "The small, boring, daily tasks matter more than the rare moments of hype. You are not what you plan to do someday — you are what you repeatedly do when no one else cares. Build that identity with action. Prove your future to yourself by doing something about it today, no matter how small it feels."
  ],
  thicc: [ // 71+ palabras
    "Success doesn’t arrive in one loud moment. It builds silently, over years of quiet focus, consistent routines, and choices made when no one’s watching. The version of you who reaches your goals is the version who kept going on the days it felt pointless — who got up early, stayed late, and kept promises to yourself when quitting would’ve been easier. That’s the work that compounds. That’s what real commitment looks like.",
    "The hardest part of any journey is continuing when progress seems invisible, when effort feels wasted, and when others have long stopped believing. But in those moments, if you keep going, you build something no one can take from you: discipline, resilience, and belief in your own ability to endure. That’s the stuff success is truly made from — not just the rewards, but the strength you earn along the way.",
    "You’ll never know how strong you are until you do the hard things over and over again, without applause or recognition. Every time you act with discipline, you’re casting a vote for the type of person you want to become. It’s not about achieving a single goal — it’s about building a life of integrity, self-respect, and clarity. A life that reflects your values, not your impulses.",
    "Most people stop when it gets hard. But if you decide to push through — not with perfection, but with consistency — you’ll find that the real gift isn’t just achieving the goal. It’s realizing you became someone who didn’t stop. Someone who didn’t fold under pressure. Someone who kept going, especially when the finish line wasn’t in sight. That’s when the breakthrough happens. That’s when it all starts to change.",
    "This isn’t about doing more — it’s about doing what matters. You don’t need to burn out chasing motivation. What you need is a system. A rhythm. A commitment to your future self that says: 'I will show up, no matter how I feel.' Because feelings are temporary, but your actions shape reality. If you’re tired of starting over, stop quitting. If you’re tired of wishing, start working. Today."
